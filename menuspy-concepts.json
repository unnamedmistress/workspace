    "raw_user_input": "MenuSpy - a food/menu analysis app. Problem: People want to understand what's in their food when eating out - calories, allergens, nutrition, ingredients. But restaurant menus don't provide this information clearly.",
    "reframed_problem": "Diners face information asymmetry at restaurants: they cannot reliably assess nutritional content, allergen risks, or ingredient quality before ordering. Current solutions require manual lookup or guesswork, creating friction, health risks, and decision paralysis. The challenge is delivering accurate, contextualized food intelligence at the moment of decision without disrupting the dining experience.",
    "key_objectives": [
      "Provide instant, accurate nutritional and allergen data for restaurant menu items",
      "Minimize friction and preserve the natural dining flow",
      "Build trust through transparency and verifiable sources",
      "Scale across diverse restaurant types and cuisines without requiring universal restaurant participation",
      "Empower users with different needs (allergies, diets, fitness goals) with personalized insights"
    ],
    "hard_constraints": [
      "Menu items vary by location, preparation method, and chef discretion",
      "Restaurants are not legally required to provide detailed nutrition data (except chains >20 locations in some jurisdictions)",
      "Users need answers in <10 seconds at the table, not after extensive research",
      "Cannot rely on restaurants updating data in real-time",
      "Must handle ambiguity (\"market vegetables\", \"chef's special sauce\") gracefully"
    ]
  },
  "global_insights": {
    "opportunity_space_summary": "The gap between regulatory disclosure requirements and consumer demand for food transparency creates a massive opportunity. While large chains must disclose calories, independent restaurants and international cuisines remain opaque. The rise of dietary personalization (keto, vegan, low-FODMAP), serious allergy concerns, and fitness tracking culture creates strong willingness to pay for instant intelligence. Opportunity exists in B2C (direct to diners), B2B (restaurants wanting to differentiate), and B2B2C (delivery platforms, health apps).",
    "common_themes_across_ideas": "Most viable solutions combine crowdsourcing, AI estimation, and strategic data partnerships rather than waiting for full restaurant adoption. Success depends on managing uncertainty transparently — users will tolerate estimates if confidence levels are clear. Strong network effects emerge when user contributions improve data quality. Privacy-conscious approaches (local processing, anonymous aggregation) build trust. Integration points with existing behaviors (taking menu photos, scanning QR codes) reduce activation energy.",
    "major_risks_or_unknowns": "Accuracy liability: incorrect allergen data could cause serious harm. Data freshness: menus change seasonally, recipes evolve. Restaurant resistance: some may view nutritional transparency as competitive disadvantage. User trust: one wrong call on allergen data destroys credibility. Monetization timing: charging too early limits network effects, but free forever is unsustainable. Regulatory uncertainty: laws may require disclaimers that scare users away."

        "core_solution": "MenuLens uses on-device computer vision to recognize menu text (via OCR) and dish images, then overlays nutrition badges (calories, protein, common allergens) directly on the camera viewfinder in real-time, like AR translation apps.

Users can tap any dish for deeper breakdowns and ingredient lists.",

Crowd verification creates network effects: the more users scan menus, the better the database. Freemium model allows viral growth. Restaurants can claim/verify their data for accuracy badge, creating B2B revenue stream.",
        "what_makes_it_different": "Unlike search-based apps (MyFitnessPal, CalorieKing), there's no manual lookup.

Under the hood: LLM (GPT-4/Claude) connected to nutrition database + allergen database + ingredient knowledge base. User says 'I'm vegetarian and trying to hit 150g protein today. What should I order at Chipotle?'—MenuGPT reasons through the menu, suggests 'Sofritas bowl with double beans and guac = 40g protein.
