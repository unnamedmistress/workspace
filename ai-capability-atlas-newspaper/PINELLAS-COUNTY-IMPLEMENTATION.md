## 🚀 Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 1: Pinellas County MVP
1. ✅ Add Pinellas County to `PERMIT_PORTALS` database
2. ✅ Implement guided questions for top 5 projects:
   - Hot water heater
   - Bathroom remodel
   - Deck
   - HVAC replacement
   - Re-roof
3. ✅ Add engineering detection for Pinellas-specific rules
4. ✅ Create permit link routing (city vs county)
5. ✅ Build rich answer templates with Pinellas data

### Phase 2: Expand Coverage
- Add other Pinellas cities (St. Pete, Clearwater, etc.)
- Add neighboring counties (Hillsborough, Pasco)
- Create comparison tool (city vs county permits)

### Testing Address
**Use this Pinellas County address for testing:**
- 3701 60th St N, St. Petersburg, FL 33710
- Should detect: City limits (St. Pete) vs unincorporated vs partner city
- Should route: St. Pete permit portal OR Pinellas County portal
