Skill: Use AI to organise a small event by asking clear, step-by-step questions.
Context scenario: You and two friends want to throw a surprise birthday party for a family member. You need to pick a theme, plan a budget and decide on food and decorations.
Prompts to try:
- "I want help planning a surprise birthday for my sibling. There will be eight guests and we have $150. Suggest a fun theme, simple decorations and budget-friendly food ideas."
- "Here are three theme ideas: garden picnic, retro 80s, and movie night. Which one fits a $150 budget and can be set up in a small living room? Break down costs for food, decorations and activities."
- "Draft a simple shopping list for an 80s-themed party with finger foods and DIY decorations. Keep the total under $150."
What you’ll learn: How to frame a clear question with budget and guest count; how to ask AI to compare options and break down costs; and how to convert ideas into an actionable list that fits your budget.
