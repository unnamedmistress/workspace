# Changelog - AI Capability Atlas Newspaper

All changes to the taxonomy and structure through the 9-round adversarial refinement process.

## Versioning
- **v0**: Initial taxonomy (Capability Architect)
- **v1**: Post-first-critique revision  
- **v2**: Cognitive integration (Educational Psychologist)
- **v3**: Final taxonomy after second critique and use case expansion

## v0 (Initial Taxonomy)
*Status: Complete*

### Summary
- **Domains**: 5 (Knowledge & Learning, Creativity & Content, Productivity & Planning, Communication & Collaboration, Problem Solving & Analysis)
- **Categories**: 8
- **Capabilities**: 7
- **Cognitive Skills**: 22
- **Depth**: 6 layers achieved
- **Exclusions**: All developer/integration/API capabilities excluded
- **Focus**: Everyday user tasks in modern AI chat tools

### Planned Changes for v1
Based on Round 1 adversarial critique:
1. **Domain consolidation**: Eliminate Communication & Collaboration and Productivity & Planning domains; merge capabilities into remaining domains
2. **Category redesign**: Rebuild categories around user goals (Learn, Create, Decide, Improve, Solve) rather than AI functions
3. **Cognitive skill hierarchy**: Group 22 skills into foundational/intermediate/advanced levels with progression pathways
4. **Depth expansion**: Each capability to have 3–5 use cases, each with 3–5 example prompts
5. **Missing capabilities**: Add Personal & Wellness, Entertainment & Leisure, Practical Skills, Social & Emotional capabilities
6. **Cross-referencing**: Implement tags/links to show relationships across domains

### Planned Changes for v2  
*To be populated after Round 3 cognitive integration*

### Planned Changes for v3
*To be populated after Round 6 final revision*

## Round-by-Round Changes

### Round 0: Initial Taxonomy (Capability Architect)
- **Start**: 2026-02-16 02:02 UTC
- **End**: 2026-02-16 02:17 UTC
- **Changes**:
  - Created 5 domains: Knowledge & Learning, Creativity & Content, Productivity & Planning, Communication & Collaboration, Problem Solving & Analysis
  - Established 8 categories with 7 tactical capabilities
  - Developed 22 cognitive skills explicitly linked to capabilities
  - Built 6-layer depth: Domain → Category → Capability → Use Case → Example Prompt → Cognitive Skill
  - Excluded all developer/integration/API capabilities
  - Focused on everyday user tasks in modern AI chat tools

### Round 1: Adversarial Destruction (Skeptical Analyst)
- **Start**: 2026-02-16 02:34 UTC
- **End**: 2026-02-16 02:36 UTC
- **Critique Focus**:
  - Weak category identification and destruction (3 categories recommended)
  - Redundancy removal (mapping table created)
  - Cognitive integration gaps (flat skill list identified)
  - Everyday usability assessment (superficial depth noted)
  - 3+ substantive objections (3 objections with evidence)
- **Key Findings**:
  1. Artificial domain fragmentation creates redundancy
  2. Cognitive skills lack hierarchy and integration
  3. Depth compliance is superficial (deep but narrow branches)
- **Destruction Recommendations**:
  - Eliminate Communication & Collaboration domain entirely
  - Eliminate Productivity & Planning domain entirely  
  - Merge Problem Solving & Analysis into Knowledge & Learning
- **Revision Roadmap**: Consolidate to 3 core domains, rebuild categories around user goals, introduce cognitive skill framework, deepen each branch, add missing capabilities, implement cross-referencing.

### Round 2: Taxonomy Revision (Capability Architect)
- **Start**: 2026-02-16 02:38 UTC
- **End**: 2026-02-16 02:50 UTC
- **Changes Implemented**:
  - ✅ Eliminated Communication & Collaboration and Productivity & Planning domains
  - ✅ Consolidated to 3 core domains (Knowledge & Learning, Creativity & Content, Analysis & Problem Solving - partial)
  - ✅ Redesigned categories around user goals: Learn New Things, Create Things, Improve Work, Research & Analyze
  - ✅ Implemented cognitive skill hierarchy: foundational/intermediate/advanced levels
  - 🔄 Partial depth expansion: some capabilities have 2-3 use cases with example prompts
  - 🔄 Missing capabilities addition: Personal & Wellness, Entertainment & Leisure pending for v1.1
- **Structural Improvements**:
  - Cognitive skills now grouped by proficiency level with progression pathways
  - User-goal categories replace AI-function categories
  - Domain consolidation reduces cognitive overhead
  - Cross-referencing framework established for future implementation

### Round 3: Cognitive Integration (Educational Psychologist)
