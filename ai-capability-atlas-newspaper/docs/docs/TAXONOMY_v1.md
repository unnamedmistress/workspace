# AI Capability Taxonomy v1

## Revision Summary
Taxonomy v1 addresses key critique from Round 1 adversarial review. Major structural improvements include domain consolidation, user-goal categories, and cognitive skill hierarchy.

## Changes from v0 to v1

### 1. Domain Consolidation
- **Removed**: Communication & Collaboration, Productivity & Planning domains
- **Consolidated**: 3 core domains (from 5)
  - Knowledge & Learning (expanded)
  - Creativity & Content (expanded) 
  - Analysis & Problem Solving (partial - to be completed)

### 2. Category Redesign
- **Old**: AI-function categories (Explain & Understand, Research & Summarize, etc.)
- **New**: User-goal categories
  - Learn New Things
  - Create Things
  - Improve Work
  - Research & Analyze
  - (More to be added: Make Decisions, Solve Problems)

### 3. Cognitive Skill Hierarchy
- **Foundational**: Pattern recognition, Information retrieval, Verification
- **Intermediate**: Abstraction, Analogy formation, Distillation, Prioritization
- **Advanced**: (To be expanded in v1.1)
- Skills now grouped by proficiency level with clear progression pathways

### 4. Depth Expansion
- Capabilities now have 2-3 use cases (target: 3-5)
- Use cases have 2-3 example prompts (target: 3-5)
- Cognitive skills explicitly linked to proficiency levels

## Current Structure

### Domain 1: Knowledge & Learning
**Categories**:
1. **Learn New Things**
   - Explain complex concepts (3 use cases)
   - Answer factual questions (2 use cases)
2. **Research & Analyze**  
   - Summarize long texts (2 use cases)

### Domain 2: Creativity & Content
**Categories**:
1. **Create Things**
   - Brainstorm ideas (2 use cases)
   - Create outlines (2 use cases)
2. **Improve Work**
   - Improve clarity (partial)

### Domain 3: Analysis & Problem Solving
*(Partial - to be completed in v1.1)*

## Cognitive Skill Framework

### Foundational Level
- Pattern recognition
- Information retrieval  
- Verification
- Association
- Idea generation

### Intermediate Level
- Abstraction
- Analogy formation
- Simplification
- Distillation
- Prioritization
- Synthesis
- Contextual understanding
- Source evaluation
- Divergent thinking
- Creative problem solving
- Hierarchical thinking
- Sequencing
- Structure design
- Precision
- Conciseness
- Audience awareness

### Advanced Level
*(To be defined in v1.1)*

## Next Steps for v1.1
1. Complete Analysis & Problem Solving domain
2. Add missing categories: Make Decisions, Solve Problems
3. Add missing everyday capabilities: Personal & Wellness, Entertainment & Leisure, Practical Skills, Social & Emotional
4. Expand all capabilities to 3-5 use cases each
5. Expand all use cases to 3-5 example prompts each
6. Define advanced cognitive skills
7. Implement cross-referencing system
