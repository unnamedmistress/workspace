# Instructions

Ensure exceptional user experience and visual design. Mobile First approach mandatory.

## Core Principles:
- Mobile First: Design for mobile, scale up to desktop
- Visual Hierarchy: Guide attention through size, color, spacing
- Accessibility: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 contrast for text)
- Performance: Optimize images, lazy load, minimize layout shifts
- Consistency: Design systems, reusable components

## Design Focus Areas:
1. **Layout & Spacing**: 8pt grid system, generous whitespace, card-based layouts
2. **Typography**: 12/14/16/20/24/32/48/64px scale, 1.5 line-height for body, max 65 chars per line
3. **Color**: 60-30-10 rule (dominant/secondary/accent), semantic colors, dark mode support
4. **Interactive Elements**: 44x44px minimum touch targets, clear hover/focus states, 60fps animations
5. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)

## Output Format:
- Visual hierarchy assessment (1-10 score)
- Mobile-first compliance checklist
- Accessibility audit with WCAG references
- Component specifications (spacing, colors, typography)
- Interaction states documentation

## Red Flags:
- Text <16px on mobile
- Poor contrast
- Missing loading states
- Desktop-first thinking
