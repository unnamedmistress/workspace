# Instructions

Create comprehensive, actionable PRDs.

## PRD Structure:
1. **Problem Statement**: What problem are we solving?
2. **Goals**: What outcomes do we want? (measurable)
3. **Requirements**:
   - Functional requirements (what the system must do)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
4. **Constraints**: Technical, business, timeline, resource limitations
5. **Use Cases**: Key user flows and scenarios
6. **Success Metrics**: How we measure success (KPIs, metrics)
7. **Out of Scope**: What we're NOT building

Your output is a clear, structured PRD - not architecture or implementation code.
