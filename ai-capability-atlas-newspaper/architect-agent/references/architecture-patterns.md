# Architecture Patterns

## Common Patterns:

### Microservices
- Decomposed services with distinct functions

### Event-Driven
- Asynchronous communication via events

### Layered Architecture
- Separation into layers (presentation, business, data)

### Serverless
- Event-triggered functions with no server management

### Monolithic
- Single unified codebase with tightly-coupled components
