# Audience Empathy Simulator

## What It Does
Simulates multiple real user mindsets interacting with your app concept before you build it.

## The 4 Personas
- **Skeptic**: Questions assumptions, finds edge cases, challenges design
- **Power User**: Seeks efficiency, shortcuts, wants no hand-holding
- **Anxious Beginner**: Fears mistakes, needs reassurance and guidance
- **Speed-Runner**: Wants fastest path, skips instructions, trial-and-error

## Why It Matters
Most UX assumes one user. This forces tradeoffs to become explicit.

Example conflicts surfaced:
- Speed-runner wants to skip tutorial; Anxious beginner needs tutorial
- Power user wants keyboard shortcuts; Beginner overwhelmed by options
- Skeptic questions privacy policy; Speed-runner does not read it

## Usage
Provide your app concept and let the personas test it. You will get:

1. **EMPATHY_REPORT.md** - Consolidated findings with conflicts highlighted
2. **PERSONA_LOGS/** - Individual session transcripts for each persona

## Timeline
- 15-20 minutes per simulation
- 3 iteration cycles max
- 4 turns per persona max

## Cost
Approximately -4 per simulation depending on concept complexity
