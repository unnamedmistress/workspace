## Architecture (System Design):
- Keywords: "architecture", "design plan", "system layout"

## Build (Implementation):

## Detailed Routing Rules:
- If a task requires detailed understanding, assign to **vision**.
- If a task involves creating specifications, assign to **prd**.
- If a task focuses on system design, assign to **architecture**.
- If a task involves coding or development, assign to **build**.
- For testing and quality assurance, assign to **qa**.
- For deployment-related tasks, assign to **deployment**.
