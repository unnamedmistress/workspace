### Vercel Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Auto-deploy stopped working for original `tandem` project
- Last successful deploy: 3h ago (tandem-gamma.vercel.app)
- Cause: GitHub commits authored as "OpenClaw Agent" not triggering builds

**Solution:** Created new repo `tandem-learning-platform-new`
- Fixed PostCSS/Tailwind v4 config
- Successfully deployed all 15 improvements

**Current Projects:**
- `tandem-learning-platform-new` (working - all improvements)
- `tandem` (original - stale, needs cleanup)
- 4 other variants from failed attempts (need deletion)

**Live URL:** https://tandem-learning-platform-new.vercel.app
