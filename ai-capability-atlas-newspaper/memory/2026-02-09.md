## TANDEM Project - Session Log 2026-02-09 (Evening)

### Deployment Status: BUILD WORKING but LAYOUT STILL LEFT-ALIGNED

**Problem:**
- Successfully fixed JSX structure errors - builds are now passing
- Layout is still left-aligned instead of centered
- Multiple attempts with text-center class and inline styles not applying

**Recent Changes:**
- Completely rewrote page.tsx with clean JSX structure (5119eb7)
- Removed conflicting layout wrapper from layout.tsx (1928b9e)
- Added text-center class to main (f8e196b)
- Added inline style textAlign: 'center' (3805109)

**Current State:**
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Deployment: ✅ Live at https://tandem-learning-platform.vercel.app
- Layout: ❌ Still left-aligned
- Buttons: ❌ Unstyled

**Next Steps Needed:**
1. Fix centering issue (text-center/tailwind not applying)
2. Style buttons properly
3. Improve navigation design
4. Complete Creative Assembly Line work

**Attempts Made:**
- Tailwind text-center class - not working
- Inline style textAlign: 'center' - pushed, waiting to verify
- Suspected CSS specificity or build cache issue

**Context:**
- Working on Creative Assembly Line implementation
- User wants continuous updates every 10 minutes
- Do not stop unless blocked
- Layout centering is critical priority
