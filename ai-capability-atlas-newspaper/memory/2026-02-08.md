## TANDEM Learning Platform Design & Build

### What Was Created
Designed **TANDEM** - a revolutionary AI collaboration learning platform that breaks all traditional learning assumptions.

**Core Concept:** Practice-based learning where users bring real work problems and develop AI collaboration skills side-by-side with an AI partner that challenges, surprises, and reflects patterns back to them.

**NOT:**
- Course catalog or content library
- Lectures, slides, exams, or "training energy"
- AI explaining how to use AI
- Corporate L&D vibes

**IS:**
- Real work dilemmas solved through practice
- AI as imperfect collaborator (sometimes frustrating by design)
- Mirror phase that shows learners their own patterns
- No grades - depth markers (Surface/Structure/Judgment/Fluency)

### The 6 Classes

1. **Create a Mobile App** - Maker energy, prototyping with AI
2. **Microsoft Copilot for Students** - Academic power without cheating
3. **Solving Business Problems** - Pragmatic, stakeholder-focused
4. **Generative AI Prompting Essentials** - Conversation, not commands
5. **AI for Research & Analysis** - Augmentation, not automation
6. **AI Literacy** - Working understanding, not technical mastery

### The Practice Arc (Shared Structure)
All 24 lessons (4 per class) follow this 4-phase flow:
- **Phase A - The Real Mess:** Bring problem, AI interviews for context
- **Phase B - First Attempt:** Try with AI, observe friction
- **Phase C - The Mirror:** AI reflects patterns, shows alternatives
- **Phase D - Second Attempt:** Apply insight, experience difference

### Key Features
- **AI Personality Profiles:** The Skeptic, The Optimist, The Literalist, The Connector
- **Challenge Board:** Community-submitted real problems
- **Uncertainty Log:** Private reflection space, AI surfaces patterns over time
- **Skill Tokens:** Collectible observations about working style (not points)
- **15-Minute Onboarding:** No tour - starts with "What's annoying you at work?"

### Build Progress

**Phase 1 - Foundation Complete:**
- Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript project initialized
- shadcn/ui components installed (button, card, input, textarea, dialog, badge, avatar, tabs, scroll-area, separator, tooltip, dropdown-menu)
- Type definitions created: `app/lib/types.ts`
- AI personalities defined: `app/lib/data/aiPersonalities.ts`
- User state hook: `app/lib/hooks/useUser.tsx`
- Initial commit made

**Phase 2 - GitHub Repository Created:**
- Repo: https://github.com/unnamedmistress/tandem-learning-platform
- Public, description added
- Pushed initial foundation

**Phase 3 - Parallel Codex Agents Running:**
- `rapid-mist`: Building classes.ts (6 classes, 24 lessons)
- `ember-orbit`: Building challenges.ts (15-20 community challenges)
- `warm-bison`: Building AIChat.tsx component

**Current Time:** 2026-02-09 ~01:30 UTC
**Location:** `/home/node/workspace/tandem`
**ETA:** ~30-45 minutes for full platform

### Design Principles Captured
- Optimize for engagement, judgment, confidence — not knowledge transfer
- Learning happens through trying, noticing, adjusting
- AI behaves imperfectly to teach recognition
- Platform fits into workflow cracks, not dedicated time blocks
- If something feels familiar, mutate it

### Next Steps (Post-Build)
1. Verify build succeeded
2. Test onboarding flow
3. Check all 6 classes render correctly
4. Verify AI personality switching works
5. Test Challenge Board functionality
6. Review accessibility (keyboard nav, focus states)
7. Consider deployment to staging
