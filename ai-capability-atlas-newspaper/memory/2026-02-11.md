## TANDEM App Simplification (COMPLETED)

### Onboarding Changes
- Streamlined onboarding from 5 steps → 3 steps (welcome → goals → ready)
- Removed "how-it-works" step (too much friction)
- Removed personality selector - now uses single default "Optimist" AI partner
- After onboarding completion, user redirected directly to `/missions` instead of `/classes`
- Updated landing page stats: "Training Missions" and "Challenges" instead of "Practice Classes" and "AI Partners"

### Navigation Changes
- Removed Classes from navigation
- Navigation now: Missions / Challenges / Profile only
- "Browse Classes" button changed to "Browse Missions"

### Code Changes
- Modified: `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- Modified: `app/page.tsx`
- Build successful, pushed to `tandem-learning-platform-new` main branch

## TANDEM App Interactive Features (IN PROGRESS)

### Issues Found
1. **Mission Page** (`app/mission/[id]/page.tsx`): "Start Mission" button does nothing - no onClick handler
2. **Mission Flow**: No interactive phases - static content only
3. **Badge Earning**: Completing missions doesn't award skill badges to user profile
4. **Challenge Completion**: No completion flow or badge earning
5. **Viewport Issues**: Some dropdowns/interactions may not work properly

### Work Started
- Spawned sub-agent to fix interactive features
- Sub-agent added imports and state setup to mission page but didn't complete implementation
- Still need to add:
  - Start Mission button functionality
  - Chat interface for missions (similar to challenges)
  - Phase progression (setup → attempt → feedback → retry → completed)
  - Badge awarding on completion via `addSkillToken`
  - Mark completion via `completeLesson`
  - Challenge completion flow

### Next Steps
- Complete mission page interactive functionality
- Ensure missions can be completed and badges earned
- Test all interactive elements work
- Fix any viewport/layout issues

## Key Technical Notes

### User Context Available
- `useUser()` hook provides: `addSkillToken`, `completeLesson`, `user.skillTokens`
- User data stored in localStorage with key "tandem-user"

### Mission Data Structure
- Missions have phases: setup, attempt, feedback, retry
- Each mission has a `skillBadge` with name, description
- Missions defined in `app/lib/data/missions.ts`

### Files to Complete
- `/app/mission/[id]/page.tsx` - needs full interactive implementation
- `/app/challenge/[id]/page.tsx` - needs completion flow
- Verify `/app/profile/page.tsx` displays earned badges correctly
