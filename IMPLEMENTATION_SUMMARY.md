## ✅ Mission Complete!

I've successfully enhanced PermitPath with intelligent permit determination and guided submission. The app now explains EXACTLY whether a permit is needed, why, where to submit, and how to fill out the application.

## 🎯 What Was Delivered

### 1. ✅ Research Phase - COMPLETE

**Comprehensive research conducted on:**
- Pinellas County & Florida Building Code permit requirements
- Distinction between cosmetic (no permit) vs structural/plumbing/electrical (permit required)
- Specific thresholds: $500 minimum, fixture movement, circuit additions, structural changes
- St. Petersburg vs Pinellas County jurisdiction boundaries
- Permit submission locations and procedures
- Required inspections and documentation

**Research findings documented in:** `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`

**Key Findings:**
- **NO PERMIT NEEDED:** Cosmetic work (paint, fixture replacement in same location, tile surface only)
- **PERMIT REQUIRED:** Moving fixtures, adding circuits, structural changes, work over $500
- **Code Citations:** FRC §P105.2 (plumbing), §E3801.2 (electrical), §R105.2 (building)
